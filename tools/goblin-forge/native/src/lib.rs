//! The Goblin runtime.
//!
//! Everything a compiled program needs that is not machine code the compiler
//! emitted: the string representation, its operations, `console`, and the live
//! allocation counter.
//!
//! It is reached through exactly the same `extern "C"` boundary user code uses.
//! There is no privileged channel, which means the runtime is testable as an
//! ordinary C library and that a bug here looks like a bug anywhere else.
//!
//! # The string representation
//!
//! `string` is one machine word — a pointer to the first byte — with a header
//! sitting *behind* it:
//!
//! ```text
//!   [ len: u64 ][ owned: u64 ][ bytes … ][ 0 ]
//!                             ^ the `string` value points here
//! ```
//!
//! Three properties fall out, and all three are load-bearing:
//!
//! * `length` is a load, not a scan.
//! * The pointer is a valid C `char *`, so a string crosses to a native
//!   function without conversion.
//! * A **literal** is static data laid out in exactly this shape, with
//!   `owned = 0`. Freeing one is a no-op, so "the binding's scope releases it"
//!   has no exceptions — which is what keeps ownership a property of the type
//!   rather than of where the value came from.

//! # Why this crate is `no_std`
//!
//! Not for the usual reason. Nothing here is freestanding — the runtime calls
//! libc on every page, and is linked into a program that has a full C runtime
//! under it. What `no_std` buys is the ability to write our own
//! [`panic_handler`], which on stable Rust is the only way to stop linking
//! std's.
//!
//! std's panic hook resolves a backtrace, which drags in the whole DWARF
//! symbolizer — gimli, addr2line, rustc_demangle, miniz_oxide. That was 182 KB
//! of the 259 KB of sized symbols in a program that computes a factorial and
//! prints nothing, and every byte of it was unreachable: `main` is emitted by
//! the compiler, not by Rust, so no Rust panic ever runs to print anything.
//! `panic = "abort"` does not help — it removes the unwinder, not the hook.
//!
//! The cost is that the eleven places this crate wanted std are written against
//! libc instead. They are all in this file, all marked, and none of them are
//! subtle; see [`stdio`], [`env_is_set`], and [`Digits`].

// A cdylib exports the Rust symbols it defines. It does **not** re-export C

// already passes. Three mechanisms, one of them a hard link error, and only the
// first testable on the machine this was written on.
//
// A trampoline is a Rust symbol, so it exports from a staticlib and a cdylib
// identically, on all three, with no linker argument anywhere. The second
// benefit is the one that will matter later: this is *our* ABI, so the
// allocator underneath it can change again without the published surface

//
// **Deterministic, and not seeded.** The same value hashes to the same number in
// every process, on every platform, in every run. That is the opposite of what a
// language hosting untrusted input wants — there is no HashDoS resistance here
// and none is claimed — and it is the right trade for this one: a simulation
// that iterates a map has to replay identically, and a test suite that asserts
// on printed output cannot have iteration order move between runs.

///
/// Every hash here ends with this, and the reason is where the result is *used*.
/// A hash table takes the low bits — `h & (capacity - 1)` — so a mixer whose
/// entropy sits in the high bits is a table whose buckets all collide. FNV-1a
/// alone has exactly that weakness for short keys, and an integer key that is
/// just cast to `u64` has it completely: consecutive ids would land in
/// consecutive buckets and every removal would leave a probe chain behind it.

/// multiplication chain longer than two, and is the one whose constants are

//   * **The three standard streams are static** and therefore counted by
//     nothing. Closing one is a no-op rather than an error: they are the

// `f64` and `fsin` an `f32`, and neither promotes: a language with fixed widths
// and no implicit narrowing cannot have one `sin` without deciding, silently,
// which width a caller meant. The prefix is the decision, written down.
//
// The implementation is the `libm` crate rather than the platform's, and the
// reasoning is in `Cargo.toml` beside the dependency: nothing adds `-lm` to a
// Goblin link, and a MUSL port gives the same answer on all three targets where
// the platforms' own libms disagree in the last ulp. This project asserts on
// printed output, so that difference is one expected string against three.
//
// These are the only entry points here that are **not** `unsafe`: a float is a
// float, there is no pointer to get wrong, and every one of them is total —
// `dsqrt(-1)` is a NaN rather than a trap, exactly as C's is.
