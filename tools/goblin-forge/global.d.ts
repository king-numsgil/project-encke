/**
 * goblin-forge ambient prelude.
 *
 * This file defines the *entire* global surface of the language. It is compiled
 * with `noLib: true`, so nothing from `lib.dom.d.ts` / `lib.es*.d.ts` exists:
 * no `console`, no `Math`, no `Array` methods, no `any`. A stock TypeScript
 * toolchain (tsc, tsserver, WebStorm, eslint) reads this file and nothing else
 * special — there are no compiler plugins and no custom syntax anywhere.
 *
 * Everything declared here is *ambient*. None of it has a runtime
 * representation of its own; the compiler recognises these declarations by name
 * and lowers them directly to machine operations.
 *
 * The language this describes is C++'s value semantics wearing TypeScript's
 * syntax. The differences that will surprise a TypeScript programmer are
 * deliberate and permanent:
 *
 *   * **Objects are values.** `const b = a; b.x = 5` leaves `a` untouched.
 *   * **Copying a class slices.** Polymorphism travels through `Reference<T>`
 *     and `Pointer<T>`, never through values.
 *   * **The prototype is fixed.** Assigning a method on an instance is an error
 *     even though tsc accepts it.
 *   * **No truthiness.** `if (n)` on a number is an error.
 *   * **Fixed-width arithmetic**, with implicit promotion only where it cannot
 *     lose a value.
 */

/**
 * `FixedArray<T, N>`: exactly `N` elements, inline, with no allocation at all.
 *
 * This is C's `T name[N]`, and the thing worth being precise about is that a
 * fixed array **is** the bytes rather than a pointer to them:
 *
 *     const buf: FixedArray<u8, 128> = fixedArray(128, 0);
 *     sizeOf<FixedArray<u8, 128>>();   // 128, not 8
 *
 * A C array decays to a pointer in most expression contexts, which is where the
 * intuition that it *is* one comes from. It is not, and the difference shows
 * everywhere it matters: as a struct field it occupies its whole layout inline,
 * copying the struct copies the elements with it, and nothing is ever handed to
 * an allocator.
 *
 * Its storage class is therefore **inline**, not "stack" — a fixed array inside
 * a heap-allocated object is on the heap, and is still inline. The scope that
 * owns the *parent* reclaims it, and destroys each element in reverse order if
 * the element type owns anything.
 *
 * The length is part of the type, so `FixedArray<u8, 8>` and `FixedArray<u8, 4>`
 * are different types and tsc says so.
 *
 * A fixed array **decays to a `Pointer<T>`** — C's array-to-pointer conversion,
 * and what makes a C function taking `uint8_t*` callable with one. It decays to
 * a `Pointer<unknown>` too, so `char buf[1024]` reaches a `void *` parameter the
 * way it does in C, and to no other pointer type. The relation runs one way
 * only: a pointer never becomes a fixed array, because it does not carry a
 * length.
 *
 * A *temporary* array may be decayed into a call, which finishes before the
 * temporary does, but not bound to a name that would outlive it. `free()` and `freeArray()` are inherited and are undefined
 * behaviour on a fixed array, exactly as `free(buf)` is in C — this is an unsafe
 * language on purpose, and the alternative is a second pointer type whose only
 * difference is which mistakes it permits.

// in between is refused (`GF0305`).

// `Pointer<T> | null` is C's nullable pointer, and `null` is C's NULL: one

 * of leaves. One level of `Partial` does not help, because overriding a nested

 *   * a **primitive** — `i32` is `number & __GfWidth<"i32">`, so it would
 *     otherwise take the object branch and map to its own brand;
 *   * a **function** — a C struct of callbacks holds `feed: () => void` as an
 *     ordinary field, and mapping over a function type gives `{}`, which
 *     accepts anything at all;
 *   * a **pointer or reference** — `Pointer<T>` is `T & CorePointer<T>`, so
 *     recursing would splice the *pointee's* fields into the initialiser and
 *     let `{ shader: { fail: 1 } }` pass for an address. `FixedArray<T, N>`
 *     extends `CorePointer<T>` and is caught here too, which is right: it is
 *     the bytes, and `fixedArray(…)` is how you make one;
 *   * an **array** — `T[]` owns its buffer, and half a buffer is not a thing.
 *
 * `[T] extends [X]` rather than `T extends X` throughout, for the same reason
 * {@link Pointer} spells it that way: a bare conditional distributes over a
 * union, and `Reference<T> | null` is a union.
 *
 * The type is deliberately looser than the language. It cannot tell a struct
 * shape from a dispatched contract — that distinction is the compiler's, not
 * tsc's — so the frontend still refuses what this admits, with a diagnostic

 * same one in a new position, because what it leaves behind is different.
 *
 * **`move` leaves nothing; `take` leaves the default.** After `move(s)` the

 * holds an empty `string`, a zeroed struct, an empty array — a real value, which
 * you may read, and which the container's destructor will destroy harmlessly.
 *
 * The reason for the split is that only one of those promises can be kept. A
 * binding is a name and the compiler can follow it; `xs[i]` with a computed `i`
 * is not something any analysis can track, so a `move` there would leave a
 * hollow slot nothing could warn you about — reading it would be a wrong answer
 * with no diagnostic. Rust refuses to move out of an index for exactly this
 * reason and offers `mem::take` instead; C++ allows it and leaves a
 * "valid but unspecified" value, which is the footgun this avoids by specifying
 * it.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const first = take(xs[0]);
 * console.log(xs[0]);        // "" — defined, not undefined behaviour

 * read: there is nothing to take and nothing to put back, so `take(counts[i])`
 * on an `i32[]` is `counts[i]`. That matters inside a generic, where `T` may
 * turn out to be either.
 *

 *
 *   * **A class** is refused. What would be left behind is an object whose
 *     constructor never ran, which is the same thing `zeroed<T>()` refuses to
 *     produce and refuses for the same reason.
 *   * **A by-value parameter** is `GF0236`, exactly as `move` is: the caller
 *     releases the argument when the call ends, so emptying the callee's copy
 *     would free the same buffer twice.

// a standard library has to be if it is going to grow — a global surface has
// room for `console` and the widths and not for a hundred functions per module.
// The specifier is a bare `std/…` name that resolves to nothing on disk, which
// is what makes it an *ambient* module: it is this declaration, and there is no
// package to install and no path to configure.
//
//     import { mi_malloc, mi_free } from "std/alloc";
//
// They exist for one job. A C library that lets its allocator be replaced —
// SDL's `SDL_SetMemoryFunctions`, and it is far from alone — wants four
// function pointers whose signatures are exactly C's `malloc`, `calloc`,
// `realloc` and `free`. Handing it these makes the library allocate from the
// same heap the program does, which turns two allocators competing over one
// address space into one:
//
// ```ts
// import { mi_calloc, mi_free, mi_malloc, mi_realloc } from "std/alloc";
//
// declare function SDL_SetMemoryFunctions(
//   malloc_fn: (size: usize) => Pointer<unknown> | null,
//   calloc_fn: (count: usize, size: usize) => Pointer<unknown> | null,
//   realloc_fn: (mem: Pointer<unknown> | null, size: usize) => Pointer<unknown> | null,
//   free_fn: (mem: Pointer<unknown> | null) => void,
// ): boolean;
//
// SDL_SetMemoryFunctions(mi_malloc, mi_calloc, mi_realloc, mi_free);
// ```
//
// Write the parameter types **exactly** as above. A function pointer is checked
// one level in, so a `(size: usize) => Pointer<unknown>` that drops the `| null`
// is a different type from `mi_malloc` and is refused — which is the check
// doing its job, because a `malloc` that cannot fail is a claim C does not make.
//
// Two things to know before reaching for them:
//
//   * **A block from here is not a Goblin value.** Nothing constructs into it,
//     nothing destroys out of it, and no scope releases it. `alloc<T>()` is what
//     you want for a `T`; these are for handing an allocator to someone else.
//   * **The library has to be told before it allocates.** SDL wants
//     `SDL_SetMemoryFunctions` before `SDL_Init`. Memory a library took from its
//     own allocator before the swap must still go back to that one, and passing
//     it to `mi_free` afterwards is heap corruption rather than a leak.

// behind a `Pointer<File>`, closed by the call you write and by nothing else —
// the same bargain `alloc` and `free` strike, and the opposite of the one a
// `string` strikes. A file nobody closes is a leak, and it is a *detected* one:
// the handle comes from the same allocator everything else does, so the
// live-allocation check counts it and a test that forgets fails.

// `fileClose` is C's `fclose`: it closes the descriptor **and** releases the
// handle, in one call, so there is no order to get wrong. Which means
// `file.free()` is never right on one of these — it would release the handle
// and leave the descriptor open. The pointer methods are inherited and cannot
// be taken away, exactly as they are on a `FixedArray`, and this is the same
// kind of mistake `free(buf)` is in C.
//
// The three standard streams are functions rather than constants, and they are
// **not** closable: `fileClose(stdout())` is a no-op rather than a way to take
// `console.log` down with it. `stdout()` writes the same bytes `console.log`
// does, through the same unbuffered path — on Windows that means going around
